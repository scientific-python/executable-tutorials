# Executable Tutorials

## Use Cases

Many organizations maintain collections of tutorials addressing realistic
problems in a science domain, with runnable code examples written and
kept current by experts in the tools. They are useful as:

- A trove of working snippets to copy and paste
- A maintained resource for self-guided learning
- A ready-to-use curriculum for hands-on workshops
- A suite of science domain-specific "integration tests" for the showcased libraries

## Key Features

This repository demonstrates one way to configure a collection of tutorials,
covering some core features:

- Source is in [MyST Markdown][] which is easy for humans to edit and review.
- The executed examples—code and results—are published as a
  [static site][static site example].
- The examples can be opened as Jupyter notebooks to run and edit:
  - In a user's local environment
  - In the cloud using [Binder][binder example]
  - (Experimental) In the user's browser via a [Jupyter Lite app][jupyterlite example]
- The examples can be tested using `pytest`, both locally and on CI.

## Try It Out

- Read the [published examples][static site example].

- Open it on [Binder][binder example] to run the examples in the cloud.

- Download and run the examples locally.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/scientific-python/executable-tutorials
  ```

  For users of [pixi][]:

  ```sh
  pixi run start
  ```

  Alternatively, install the requirements with pip and start JupyterLab.

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  jupyter lab
  ```

## Make Your Own

See the [Guide for Maintainers][] to create your own collection of tutorials.
